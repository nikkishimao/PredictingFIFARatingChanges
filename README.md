<h1>Predicting FIFA Rating Changes from Player Injuries</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Injuries are a pivotal factor in the trajectory of a professional soccer player's career, yet decisions around player development, selection, or trade are often made with limited empirical evidence on how injuries affect long-term performance. Our project seeks to address this gap by building a predictive model that estimates the change in a player’s FIFA rating based on their age, number of injuries, and the severity of those injuries. FIFA ratings are widely used as standardized performance metrics by clubs, scouts, and analysts, making them a relevant and accessible proxy for assessing the career impact of injuries.

Our primary stakeholders include soccer clubs, coaching staff, trainers, and sports analysts—individuals who can benefit from evidence-based tools to inform decisions related to injured players. By providing a model that predicts whether a player’s rating is likely to increase, decrease, or remain stable following injury, our work offers a data-driven layer of insight into post-injury performance recovery.

We approach this need by training machine learning models on a dataset that combines detailed injury histories with official FIFA ratings from the most recent seasons. While our solution is not exhaustive—due to limitations in historical data availability and the subjective nature of FIFA scores—it represents a meaningful step toward quantifying the impact of injuries on player value and developing more informed, data-supported approaches to player evaluation.</p>
